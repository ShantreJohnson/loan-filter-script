Loan Filter Script (v1)

This project applies Python and Pandas to automate the early-stage filtering of loan applications.
It mirrors real-world underwriting logic using:

Debt-to-income calculations

Credit score thresholds

Flagging high-risk applications

Basic lending analytics

CSV-based file processing

This script will evolve as I progress through my Python, SQL, and ML training.
